# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# require 'faker'
#   10.times do
#     user = User.new(name: Faker::Name.name, email:  Faker::Internet.email,
#     password:Faker::Internet.password(min_length: 6))
#     user.save
#     #range
#     rand(5..10) do

#     end
#   end
